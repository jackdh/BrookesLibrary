# Week 1

## Compostion

Two functions

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int
g :: Int -> Int
```

function composition is denoted by a dot and defined as:

```haskell
f . g :: Int -> Int
(f . g) x = f (g x)
```



## Currying

> Function of more than one argument are often written in *curried* form

```haskell
plus		:: (Int, Int) -> Int
plug (x,y)	=  x + y
```



This can be written in *curried* form as

```haskell
plusc		:: Int -> (Int -> Int)
plusc x y	= x + y
```



The advantage of this is that the fuction can be applied to one argument only.

For example: plusc 3 is the function that takes a number and adds three to it.



## Booleans

- Constants **True**, **False**
- Boolean operators
  - && (lazy)
  - || (lazy)
  - not





## Integers

Use brackets to avoid confusion with some operators.

Like `abs (-42) = 42` (This is werid don't trust it)



## Guards

> Guards can be used to give alternatives in definition of functions.
>
> **Declarative style**

```haskell
maxTwo :: Int -> Int -> Int
maxTwo x y
	   | x >= y	= x
	   | otherwise = y
```

It is possible to use multiple guards

```haskell
maxThree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
maxThree x y z
	   | x >= y && x>= z	= x
	   | y >= z				= y
	   | otherwise 			= z
```



## If then else

> This is the **expression style**

```haskell
maxTwo :: Int -> Int -> Int
maxTwo x y
		= if x >= y then x else y
```



## Where Clause

> Declaration syle

```haskell
test :: Int -> Int -> Int
test x y = ( u + 1 ) * ( v - 1 )
		where u = x + y
			  v = x - y
```

> Expression style

```haskell
test :: Int -> Int -> Int
test x y = let u = x + y
				v = x - y
		   in (u + 1) * ( v -1 )
```

Layout is important



# Week 2



## Characters *Char* Strings *String*



### Conversion

```haskell
chr :: Int -> Char
```

```
ord :: Char -> Int
```

First converts `Int` to `Char`

Second converts `Char` to `Int`



## Names

- Identifiers
  - Starts with letter
  - Contain letters, digits, underscre, prime
- Function and variables
  - Starts with lowercase letter
- types, type constructors, type classes
  - Start with capital

## Associativity

eh



## Brackets

Wrapping something in `()` turns it into a function which can then be applied to anything.



Like how if you do `(+)` then that is now a plus function



## Binding Powers

> I believe this basically means BODMAS

- For adjacent occurrences of *different* operators
- Some bind tighter than others such as * over +

```
3+5*5 means 3+(4*5)
```



**Function** binds highest

```
f n+1 means (f n) + 1
```



## Operators and Functions

> You can write a function as an operator by enclosing it in backwards quotes

```haskell
3 `max` 4 = max 3 4
```



### Where

Each coditional equation can be followed by **where** clause

```
(pattern) = (expression) where (definitions)
```

```haskell
bmiTell :: Float -> Flaot -> String
bmiTell weight height
	| bmi <= 18.5 = "You're undereight"
	| bmi <= 25.0 = "You're supposedly normal."
	| otherwise = "You're overweight!"
	where bmi = weight / height ^2
```



## Primitive Recursion

> Always need a base case

```haskell
fac :: Int -? Int
fac n
    | n == 0 = 1
    | n > 0  = face (n-1) * n
```



### Patterns

> This is when you define several equations which the passed parameter can go into.



## Tuples

> I tuple is like (Jack, 12023277, 23) :: (String, String, Int)



### Pattern Matching with Tuples

```haskell
addPair :: (Int, Int) -> Int
addPair (x,y) = x + y
```



So in the following example the student stuple defined above is passed in and then used.

```haskell
studentAge :: Student -> String
studentAge (name, id, age) = id
```



## Lists

You can concatenate a list like so

```
[1,2,3,4] ++ [4,5,6,7] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```



### Dot-dot Notation

```
[3..7] = [3,4,5,6,7]
[1,3..10] = [1,3,5,7,9]
[2,6..18] = [2,6,10,14,18]
```



#### Strings

> Aparently strings are a special case 

```
String = [Char]
['a'..'d'] = "abcd"
```

Spedical characters in strings such as \n are **not** explanded on printing

- To print them use `putStr s` instead of just `s`



## List Comprehensions

> General form [{*expression*}|{qualifiers}]

Examples

```haskell
[a+1 | a <- [1..4] ] = [2,3,4,5]
```



### Tests

> General form [{*expression*}|{qualifiers}, {test}]

```
[2*a | a <- [4..9] , odd a] = [10, 14, 18]
```



You can have multiple tests

> General form [{*expression*}|{qualifiers}, {test}, {test}]

```
[2*a | a <- [6,1,5,3] , even a, a>3] = [12]
```



# Week 3

> All about Lists

## Lists

Lists can look like this

- empty
- []
- x:xs

You can build a list using **const**

````haskell
[1,2,3,4] = 1:(2:(3:(4:[])))
````

`[]` and `:` are called *constructors*



### Types of lists

- *Nil* the empty list
  - `[] :: [a]`
- *cons* function to prefix an element onto a list
  - `(:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]`

#### Test if a list is empty

```haskell
empty :: [a] -> Bool
empty []	 = True
empty (x:xs) = False
```

This is different from `(==[])` (Remember putting in brackets makes it a function) as it has a slightly different type signature





## Polymorphism

> Means that a function can accept more than one type. Like can take Integers and Char's

```
length  :: [a] -> Int
reverse :: [a] -> Int
```



# Week 4



> Higher Order Programming (Function takes or returns a function)



## Foldr

> This basically means take a function and apply it to all in a list

```haskell
foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
foldr f e [] = e
foldr f e (x:xs) = x `f` foldr f e xs
```

Example

```haskell
sum = foldr (+) 0
and = foldr (&&) True
```



## Filter Function

> Selects every element from a list that satisfies a predicate

```haskell
filter :: (a->Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:Xs)
	| px 		= x : filter p xs
	| otherwise	= 	  filter p xs
```

Or defined as a list comprehension

```haskell
filter p xs = [x | x <- xs, p x]
```

IE:

```haskell
extractDigites	= filter isDigit
extractLetters	= filter isLetter
filter even [1..10]
```





## Lamdba Expressions

> Allows you to write a function in line

```haskell
doubleAll x = map (\n -> 2*n) x
```





















# Examples

## DoubleAll

*List Comprehension*

```haskell
doubleAll :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
doubleAll xs = [2*a | a <- xs ]
```

*Recursion*

```haskell
doubleAll [] = []
doubleAll (x:xs) = (2*x) : doubleAll xs
```



## Length of List

```haskell
length :: Int -> Int
length [] = 0
length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs
```



## Append Function

> (++)

Type

```haskell
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
```





# Paper Semeser 2 2014-2015

## Question 1

### a

Define the `nAnd` function

```haskell
nAnd :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
```

which returns the result `True` except when both its arguments are `True`.

Answer

```haskell
nAnd :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
nAnd x y= not(x && y)
```



### b & c

The function threeEqual takes three integers and returns the result True when all three integers are equal and False otherwise. For example,

```haskell
threeEqual 7 7 7 = True
```

=

```haskell
threeEqual :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool
threeEqual x y z = x == y && y == z
```



### d

Devise suitable test data for the function threeEqual.

a) I mean, 

- 7 7 7 = True
- 7 7 6 = false
- 4 5 6 = false
- 000 = true
- 999 = true

### e

The function fourEqual takes four integers and returns the result True when all four integers are equal and False otherwise. Give a definition of fourEqual which uses the function threeEqual in its definition. Include the type declaration.

=

```haskell
fourEqual :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool
fourEqual a b c d = a == b && threeEqual b c d
```



### f

The function `allEqual` takes a list of integers and returns the result `True` when all members of the list are equal and `False` otherwise. Define `allEqual`. Include the type declaration.

=

**Important** note the use of all. 

```haskell
allEqual :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
allEqual [] = True
allEqual (x:xs) = all (==x) xs
```

**all** (a -> Bool) basically says return true if all elements in this list work with this function! It's good remember it!



### g

Your definition of `allEqual` does not need to be restricted to integers. What is the most general type declaration that it could have?

```haskell
allEqual :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
allEqual [] = True
allEqual (x:xs) = all (==x) xs
```

**When comparing shit remember Eq**





## Question 2

The function `doubleAll:: [Int] -> [Int]` doubles all the values in a list of integers.

For example:

```haskell
doubleAll [1, 7, 5, 2] = [2, 14, 10, 4]
```



### a 

Give a definition of `doubleAll` using primitive recursion.

```haskell
doubleAll :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleAll [] = []
doubleAll (x:xs) = 2*x : doubleAll xs 
```



### b

Give a definition of `doubleAll` using a list comprehension

```haskell
doubleAllLc :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleAllLc xs = [2*x | x <- xs] 
```



### c

What is the most general type declaration that could be given to doubleAll?

*I would say Num => a* as you cannot double a string? maybe use Eq?



#### D

 Give a definition of doubleAll using the standard function map which is defined by

```haskell
map f [] = [] (map.1)
map f (x:xs) = f x :(map f xs) (map.2)
```

=

```haskell
doubleAllMap :: Num a => [a] -> [a]
doubleAllMap = map (*2)
```

### e

What is the type of map?

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) [a] -> [b]
```



### f

The standard function `sum` is defined by

```haskell
sum [] 		= 0 				(sum.1)
sum (x:xs) 	= x + (sum xs) 		(sum.2)
```

Complete the following proof by induction (including justification) that

```haskell
sum . doubleAll = 2 * sum
```



(sum . doubleAll) []





## Quention 3

The datatype of node labelled binary trees can be defined as follows:

```haskell
data Tree a = Nil | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
```

### a

Give an example of a value of type `Tree Int` containing at least two integers. 

```haskell
testTree :: Tree Int
testTree = Node 5 (Node 5 Nil Nil) (Node 5 Nil Nil)
```

**Tip** Write out each 'branch' empty then fill it in. This makes sure you don't miss any details



### b

Define a function to return the left subtree of a non-empty binary tree

```haskell
getLeft :: Tree a -> Tree a
getLeft Nil = Nil
getLeft (Node y l r) = l
```

**Tip** this thing to remember here is the `(Node y l r)` remember to put Node in!

### c

Define a function `member :: Int -> Tree Int -> Bool` to test whether a given integer is a member of a tree of integers.

```haskell
member :: Int -> Tree Int -> Bool
member a Nil = False
member a (Node y l r) = a == y || member a l || member a r
```



### d

 Define a function `searchTree :: Tree Int -> Bool` to test whether a tree is a binary search tree.

```haskell
inOrder :: Tree a -> [a]
inOrder Nil = []
inOrder (Node y l r) = inOrder l ++ [y] ++ inOrder r

isAscending :: [Int] -> Bool
isAscending [x] = True
isAscending (x:xs) = x <= head (xs) && isAscending xs

searchTree :: Tree Int -> Bool
searchTree = isAscending . inOrder
```

It takes a little more space but is simple enough. It works by making a inorder list. This list **will only** be ascending for it to be a binary search list.



## Question 4

### a

Explain the difference between applicative-order evaluation, normal-order evaluation and lazy evaluation.

Applicative-Order

- *Leftmost **innermost** reduction*


- All the arguments to scheme procedures are evaluated when the procedure is applied

Normal-Order

- *Leftmost **outermost** reduction*


- Delay evaluation of procedure arguments until the actual argument values are needed

Lazy-Evaluation

- Delay procedures till the last possible moment.
- Never requires more steps than applicative-order reduction
- Best of both worlds
  - Doesn't evaluate argument unless it's needed (Normal)
  - Never evaluates argument more than once (Applicative)

### b

Define the infinite list odds::[Int], which returns a list of all odd numbers:
`odds = [1, 3, 5, 7 ....]`

```haskell
odds :: [Int]
odds = [x | x <- [0..], (mod x 2) == 1]
```



### c

Define an infinite list signs::[Int], which returns an alternating list of positive and negative ones:
`signs = [1, -1, 1, -1 ....]`

```haskell
test :: Int -> Int
test x = if (mod x 2) == 1 then -1 else 1 

signs :: [Int]
signs = [test x| x <- [0..]]
```



### d

Using parts (b) and (c), and the Haskell function zipWith, or otherwise, define a
function signedodds, that returns the infinite list:
`signedodds = [1, -3, 5, -7 ....]`
Remember to include the type declaration of signedodds with its definition.

=

```haskell
signedodds :: [Int]
signedodds = zipWith (*) oddList signs
```



### e

Each Fibonacci number is defined as the sum of its two predecessors in the Fibonacci sequence:
`fibs = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ….]`
Using zipWith or otherwise, define the Fibonacci sequence and give its type

```haskell
fibs :: [Int]
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
```



## Question 5

### a

What is a higher-order uni



### b

The `foldr` function is defined by:

```haskell
foldr f e [] = e
foldr f e (x:xs) = f x (foldr f e xs) 
```



#### i) What is the type of the `foldr` function

```
(a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
```

*Think abb like aa Buh buh* then think *end thing, list, output.*



#### ii) 

Use foldr to define `sum :: [Int] -> Int` where

`sum [a0, a1, … , an] = a0 + a1 + … + an`

=

```haskell
sumR :: [Int] -> Int
sumR = foldr (+) 0
```

#### iii)

Use `foldr` together with the prelude function `min` to define a
function `minList` which returns the minimum of a non-empty list of
integers.

```haskell
minList :: [Int] -> Int
minList xs = foldr min (head xs) xs
```



### c

The filter function takes a property and a list and returns all the elements of the list which have that property. For example

```haskell
filter (<= 10) [2, 8, 19, 5, 88, 31] = [2, 8, 5]
```

#### i)

Use filter to define a function divisors which returns a list of all the
divisors of a given positive integer. For example,

```
divisors 10 = [1, 2, 5, 10]
```

=

```haskell
divisors :: Int -> [Int]
divisors x = filter (\n -> x `mod` n == 0) [1..x]
```

**Tip** so the important thing here is the lamdba. Remeber that haskel *passes* the number into the filter to check if it is okay. To be able to **get** that number you need to use the lambda as shown.



#### ii)

Give an alternative definition of `divisors` as a list comprehension.

```haskell
divisors :: Int -> [Int]
divisors x = [n | n <- [1..x], x `mod` n == 0] 
```



#### iii)

Define a function `prime :: Int -> Bool` which returns True if an
integer is `prime` and `False` otherwise

```haskell
myPrime :: Int -> Bool
myPrime x = divisors x == [1,x]
```
